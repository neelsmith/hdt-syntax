## Summary of values used in annotations




### Relations among tokens


- `conjunction`: joins two parallel items of any kind, and therefore should link to two nodes of the same kind
- `subordinate conjunction`: conjunction introducing a clause with explicit or implicit finite verb. Links to the `unitverb` of the superior clause; finite verb form of the subordinate links to this token as `unitverb`
- `relative pronoun`: this value relates a token to its antecedent substantive; it must have a second relation indicating its function in the subordinate clause. Frequently, this will be a relation to the verb of the suboridinate clause (as `subject`, `direct object` or `dative` relation), but could also be `object of preposition` of a preposition belonging to the subordinate clause.
- `unit verb`: every verbal unit should have an explicit or implicit token with a `unit verb` relation, unless the verbal unit is the initial independent clause in a sentence with asyndeton. Possible relations depend on the type of verbal unit:
    - `independent clause`: relate token to connecting word except in case of asyndeton
   - `subordinate clause`: relate token to subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun
    - `circumstantial participle`: relate participle to unit verb of superior verbal unit
    - `attributive participle`: relate participle to article?
    - `infinitive in indirect statement`: relate infinitive to verb of speaking
    - `participle in indirect statement`: relate participle to verb of speaking
    - `quote`: relate principal verb to implied or explicit verb of speaking
    - `predicate`: relate
    - `subject`
    - `direct address`
    - `complementary infinitive`
    - `supplementary participle`
    - `modal particle`
    - `adverbial`
    - `attributive`
    - `article`
    - `pronoun`
    - `dative`
    - `genitive`
